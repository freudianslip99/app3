# Primary project

> The goal was to create a single page application that would graph data from the High Flux Isotope Reactor.  
We wanted to use a modern javascript framework; Vue 3 CLI was chosen.
Vuetify provided the layout and is similar to Bootstrap.  Vue-router provided the navigation around the site via links.  VueX 
is a store that keeps counts.  You could use this to determine visits to the site or the number of times someone clicks a link.  This store is set to record the amount of times someone clicks "plot".  The plots will work with hard coded values and validation 
techniques have also been used to guide the user experience.
